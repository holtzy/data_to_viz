Postage
Postage and packing (P&P) is a flat rate of £3.90, worldwide, regardless of how many prints you order. 

Prints are sent carefully rolled in a 450mm cardboard tube, by Royal Mail. Multiple prints ordered at the same time will normally be shipped in the same tube. While I aim to dispatch your prints within 72 hours of receiving your order, please note that delivery times can vary. If you specify a workplace address on your order which in London's Zone 1, your prints may be hand-delivered in a tube to your office, rather than posted via Royal Mail. I may also hand deliver to some other locations in north, east or central London, if passing by! 

Please note that orders from outside of the EU/EEA may be subject to customs charges and other local taxes on receipt/delivery. Such orders may also take considerably longer to arrive, even though they are sent by Airmail. In practice they should take 1-2 weeks to arrive but some international orders have taken over 5 weeks to arrive. 




Returns
I hope you enjoy your print and it arrives in pristine condition, however if you are not completely satisfied, please send me an email at o.obrien (at) outlook.com to arrange its return.
