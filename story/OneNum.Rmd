Basically it looks like the table to the right.

# Histogram
***

The most common way to represent a unique numeric variable is with a histogram. Basically, the numeric variable is cut in several `bins`: between 0 and 10 euros a night, between 10 and 20 and so on. This is represented on the X axis. Then, the number of apartments per bin is counted and represented on the Y axis.

Here, it appears that about 500 appartments have a price between 80 and 90 euros. A histogram is a convenient way to visualize the data: it allows us to understand its `distribution`.

```{r, fig.align="center", warning=FALSE}
data %>%
  filter( price<300 ) %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=price)) +
    stat_bin(breaks=seq(0,300,10), fill="#69b3a2", color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.9) +
    ggtitle("Night price distribution of Airbnb appartements") +
    theme_ipsum() +
    theme(
      plot.title = element_text(size=12)
    )
```

Note that it is important to play with the `bin size` during your exploratory analysis. Let's check what happens when spliting prices by bins of 2 euros instead of 10:

```{r, fig.align="center"}
data %>%
  filter( price<300 ) %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=price)) +
    stat_bin(breaks=seq(0,300,3), fill="#69b3a2", color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.9) +
    ggtitle("Night price distribution of Airbnb appartements") +
    theme_ipsum() +
    theme(
      plot.title = element_text(size=12)
    )
```

There is a huge difference between these 2 histograms. Actually a few values are over represented in the dataset (like 58, 64, 69, 75, 80..). This is definitely a signal that you want to understand when analysing your dataset.






# Density
***

A variation of the histogram is the density plot, which is basically a smoothed version of the histogram. It represents a `kernel density estimate` of the variable. As seen for the bin size of the histogram, it is important to try several values for the `bandwidth` argument for the same reason:

<div class = "row">

<div class = "col-md-6">
```{r, fig.align="center"}
data %>%
  filter( price<300 ) %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=price)) +
    geom_density(fill="#69b3a2", color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.7, bw=10) +
    ggtitle("Bandwidth: 10") +
    theme_ipsum()
```
</div>

<div class = "col-md-6">
```{r, fig.align="center"}
data %>%
  filter( price<300 ) %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=price)) +
    geom_density(fill="#69b3a2", color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.7, bw=2) +
    ggtitle("Bandwidth: 2") +
    theme_ipsum()
```
